# ETL Project - Proposal

**Group 16 Team Members:** Nick Orewiler, Josh Rhoads, Christy Patrick

**Repo Link:**  https://github.com/jrhoads1004/ETL_project

**Datasets:**
* Campaign Funds
* Presidential Election Results<br>
*both datasets are from the Federal Election Commission and are available as an API and in CSVs https://www.fec.gov/*

**Useful investigation that could be done with the final database:**
* Campaign Fund data and Presidential Election data can be combined to determine:
  *    Does raising more funds lead to a candidateâ€™s election?
  * Which states fund more presidential campaigns?
  * Does a higher state funding lead to a candidate winning that state?
  * Which presidential candidate has more/less debt?

**Final Database:**  Relational database due to the relationship between the presidential candidate column between the two datasets
